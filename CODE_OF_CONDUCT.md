# drone-gdm: Code of Conduct

> :warning: Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within
**The New York Times** Open Source community, as well as steps to reporting
unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring
community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored.


## Goals of the New York Times Open Source Community

 1. **Be friendly; Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes
    and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
 1. **Be considerate; Be Patient**: Open Source Software is a community effort.
   _Please remember:_
     - Any change enacted has potential ramifications for your peers as well as
     end users. _Take this into account when making decisions_.
     - The community is world-wide. You may not be communicating in the primary
     language of another contributor or end user. Keep this in mind, _always_.
     - Practice patience when communicating with other members of the community.
 1. **Be respectful; Keep things civil**: Disagreement is no excuse for poor
    behavior:
     - Make your case without resorting to pejoratives or ad hominem attacks.
     - _Teach. Don't berate!_
     - Let's learn from and educate on another.
     - _Be deliberate in your choice of words. Be Kind. Be Cautious._
 1. **When disagreements arise, seek to arrive at understanding _first_**:
     - Disagreements _will_ happen - socially and technically.
     - _Take time to understand the opposing perspective before offering a
       counterpoint, issuing a rebuttal, or dismissing the idea outright._


### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community
for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as
fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we
expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or
offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully,
and do our best to right the wrong.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior or have any other
concerns, please report it by contacting us via **code@nytimes.com**.

#### Issue Handling

All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

 1. Your contact information.
 1. Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
 1. If there are additional witnesses, please include them, if you feel
    comfortable doing so.
 1. Your account of what occurred, and whether or not you believe the incident
    is presently ongoing.
 1. Publicly available record - where they exist - (e.g. a mailing list archive
    or a public IRC logger)
 1. Please include any appropriate links.
 1. Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally,
review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a
decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of
the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident.
If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be
handled by a different member of the response team.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims
of abuse.
